 *  $NAME$
 *      INKEY()
 *  $CATEGORY$
 *      API
 *  $SUBCATEGORY$
 *      User interface
 *  $ONELINER$
 *      Extracts the next key code from the Harbour keyboard buffer.
 *  $SYNTAX$
 *      INKEY( [<nTimeout>] [,<nEvents>] ) --> nKey
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *      <nTimeout> is an optional timeout value in seconds, with a granularity
 *      of 1/10th of a second. If omitted, INKEY() returns immediately. If set
 *      to 0, INKEY() waits until an input event occurs. If set to any other
 *      value, INKEY() will return either when an input event occurs or when
 *      the timeout period has elapsed. If only this parameter is specified
 *      and it is not numeric, it will be treated as if it were 0. But if both
 *      parameters are specified and this parameter is not numeric, it will be
 *      treated as if it were not present.
 *
 *      <nEvents> is an optional mask of input events that are to be enabled.
 *      If omitted, defaults to hb_set.HB_SET_EVENTMASK. Valid input masks are
 *      in inkey.ch and are explained below. It is recommended that the mask
 *      names be used rather than their numeric values, in case the numeric
 *      values change in future releases of Harbour. To allow more than one
 *      type of input event, simply add the various mask names together.
 *
 *        <table>
 *        inkey.ch            Meaning
 *
 *        INKEY_MOVE          Mouse motion events are allowed
 *        INKEY_LDOWN         The mouse left click down event is allowed
 *        INKEY_LUP           The mouse left click up event is allowed
 *        INKEY_RDOWN         The mouse right click down event is allowed
 *        INKEY_RUP           The mouse right click up event is allowed
 *        INKEY_KEYBOARD      All keyboard events are allowed
 *        INKEY_ALL           All mouse and keyboard events are allowed
 *        HB_INKEY_EXTENDED   Extended keyboard codes are used.
 *        </table>
 *
 *      If the parameter is not numeric, it will be treated as if it were set
 *      to hb_set.HB_SET_EVENTMASK.
 *  $RETURNS$
 *      0 in case of timeout with no input event, otherwise returns a value
 *      in the range -47 to 386 for keyboard events or the range 1001 to 1007
 *      for mouse events. Mouse events and non-printable keyboard events are
 *      represented by the K_<event> values listed in inkey.ch. Keyboard
 *      event return codes in the range 32 through 127 are equivalent to the
 *      printable ASCII character set. Keyboard event return codes in the
 *      range 128 through 255 are assumed to be printable, but results may
 *      vary based on hardware and nationality. If HB_INKEY_EXTENDED mode is
 *      used, then the return value for keyboard events ranges from 1 through
 *      767 and 1077 through 1491, although not all codes are used.
 *
 *      Extended key codes consist of the PC keyboard scan code and one
 *      or more offset values. If no keyboard modifier was used, then
 *      HB_INKEY_NONE is added. The Alt key adds HB_INKEY_ALT, the Ctrl
 *      key adds HB_INKEY_CTRL, the Shift key adds HB_INKEY_SHIFT, and
 *      enhanced keys (KeyPad+/ and CursorPad keys) add HB_INKEY_ENHANCED.
 *      For example, F1 is scan code 59, so if you just press F1, you get
 *      key code 315, but Alt+F1 gives 443, Ctrl+F1 gives 571, and Shift+
 *      F1 gives 699. And NumPad+/ gives 1077, 1205, 1333, and 1461. At
 *      this time, the only value that can combine with other values is
 *      HB_INKEY_ENHANCED (i.e., there are no Alt+Ctl combinations, etc.)
 *
 *      Note: The extended key code set is larger than the normal key code
 *      set. As a result, if you switch between the normal and extended
 *      modes, you need to be aware that some codes get translated into a
 *      zero in normal mode (because there is no corresponding code in
 *      normal mode) and that these codes get removed from the keyboard
 *      input buffer in normal mode and you won't be able to go back and
 *      fetch them later in extended mode.
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *      INKEY() can be used to detect input events, such as keypress, mouse
 *      movement, or mouse key clicks (up and/or down).
 *  $EXAMPLES$
 *      // Wait for the user to press the Esc key
 *      ? "Please press the ESC key."
 *      WHILE INKEY( 0.1 ) != K_ESC
 *      END
 *  $TESTS$

 *      INKEY() is compliant with the CA-Cl*pper 5.3 INKEY() function with one
 *      exception: The Harbour INKEY() function will raise an argument error
 *      if the first parameter is less than or equal to 0 and the second
 *      parameter (or the default mask) is not valid, because otherwise INKEY
 *      would never return, because it was, in effect, asked to wait forever
 *      for no events (Note: In CA-Cl*pper, this also blocks SET KEY events).
