 * This is an original work by Jim Orlowski and is placed in the
 * public domain.
 *
 * Modification history:
 * ---------------------
 *
 *    Rev 1.4   28 Sep 1991 02:56:56   GLENN
 * Moved Jim's "Tricks used" comment out of the file header and
 * into the source code area.
 *
 *    Rev 1.3   28 Sep 1991 02:52:22   GLENN
 * Jim's modifications:
 *
 *  1.  Changed SAVESCREEN() and RESTSCREEN to use MaxRow(), MaxCol()
 *      instead of 24,79
 *
 *  2.  Added Nantucket's cleaner code for:
 *        - Cleaned up logic around line 334 while loop section
 *        - Added refreshCurrent and another stabilize around line 349
 *        - TbSkipWhile was redone
 *             Note: Leo's line was changed to:
 *                 ELSEIF ( n > 0 .AND. RECNO() != LASTREC() + 1)
 *
 *  3.  Added DispBegin() and DispEnd() around both Stabilize sections
 *

/* The tricks are:
 *
 * 1. Setting up functions for goTop() and goBottom() so that you can
 *    quickly move to the right record when the user presses the
 *    Ctrl-PgUp ( goTop() ) and Ctrl-PgDn ( goBottom() ) keys.
 *
 * 2. Passing and evaluating the block for the TbSkipWhil().
