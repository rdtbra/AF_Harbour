 *  $SYNTAX$
 *     FT_POKE( <nSegment>, <nOffset>, <nValue> ) -> lResult
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *     <nSegment> is the segment of the desired memory address.
 * 
 *     <nOffset>  is the offset of the desired memory address.
 * 
 *     <nValue>   is the value to write to the desired memory address.
 *  $RETURNS$
